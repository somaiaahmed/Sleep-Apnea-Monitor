# Sleep-Apnea-Monitor

This project presents the development of a sleep apnea monitor utilizing an LDR sensor
and mirror to detect skin color changes associated with sleep apnea episodes. Sleep
apnea is a common sleep disorder with potential health side effects, requiring effective
monitoring for management and prevention of complications. The proposed monitor
has the potential to alert users or caregivers during sleep apnea episodes and track
treatment efficacy. However, this concept remains in the experimental stage and has
limited clinical adoption to date.

## IDEA

The main objective of the sleep apnea monitor is to identify changes in
blood flow and oxygen saturation during episodes of sleep apnea by
detecting alterations in skin color. This will be achieved by measuring the
amount of reflected light from the skin using an LDR sensor and
processing the data with a microcontroller, such as an Arduino. The circuit
will incorporate other essential components such as resistors and a power
source, which can be a battery or an AC adapter. The program will analyze
the data from the LDR sensor and trigger alerts when episodes of sleep
apnea are detected.

## TISSUE INTERACTION

Sleep apnea monitoring using LED, mirror, and LDR involves
emitting red light that interacts with tissue, penetrating the
skin and reaching blood vessels. Hemoglobin in the vessels
absorbs light differently based on its oxygenation, allowing
changes in blood oxygen saturation levels to be monitored
over time using an LDR. A mirror is used to reflect the light
back, aiding in light collection. The chosen monitoring site
and use of a mirror ensure accurate measurement of oxygen
saturation changes associated with sleep apnea.
